# Introduction

The Trending Media project is a React.js application that allows users to explore trending movies, TV shows, and series. It provides a user-friendly interface to browse through popular entertainment content. The application is built using modern React.js best practices and follows a responsive design to ensure a seamless experience across various devices.

The project implements various features, including authentication with login, register, and logout functionalities. Users can sign up and log in to the application to access personalized content and enjoy additional features. Protected routes are implemented to restrict access to certain pages based on user authentication status, ensuring a secure browsing experience.

Moreover, the Trending Media app integrates with external APIs to fetch up-to-date trending media data, ensuring that users always have access to the latest and most popular content. The application's state management is handled efficiently using the Context API and React hooks like useState, useEffect, useRef, and useNavigate.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
